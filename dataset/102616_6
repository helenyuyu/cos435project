If Frequently Asked Question rec.motorcycles "What DoD?", second Frequently Asked Question must "How I get DoD number?" That simple asking Keeper List (KotL, accept substitue Keepers) number. If you're feeling creative, favorite number hasn't taken already, make request, subject KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests likely earn flame KotL. Not won't get it, _will_ pay it.) Oh, one little, tiny suggestion. sk KotL e-mail. You'll laying lightning rod flames post whole net, you'll look like clueless newbie too. By you're probably asking "So who's KotL already?". Well, John Sloan notes below, that's real "secret" left around here, (un)subtle hints divulged. First, myself, anyone mentioned name posting (maybe :-), though John original KotL. Second, keeping true spirit Unix, KotL's first name two letters long, spelled entirely hexadecimal characters. (2.5, KotL hares name line- oriented text utility.) Third, occasionally een posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly boneheads "weenie mailers"). Fourth, reason suspect KotL Dead-Head. ***************** Newsflash: A message KotL ****************** Once surmounted intellectual pinnacle electronically groveled KotL, please keep mind KotL indeed work living, occasionally must pacify boss getting something done. Your request may languish mailer queue (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) week two.

If suspect mailer problems, least annotate subsequent requests indication former request submitted, lest assigned multiple numbers (what, think KotL *memorizes* list?!?). *********************************************************************** One hing, KotL says telepathic powers aren't used be. So provide information list, ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address.

Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com ------------------------------------------------------------------------ "Denizens Doom", Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161) [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted Bruce's permission] There group motorcyclists gets together normal things bunch bikers do. They discuss motorcycles motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops, helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, ickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double entendres, culture, absence culture, first rides friendship. They argue plan rides together. The difference group ocal motorcycle club that, although get together everyday, never seen face face. The members group live known world communicate electronically via computer. The computers range laptops multi-million dollar computer centers; people range college university students high-tech industry professionals public-access electronic bulletin-board users. Currently, rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's file name group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries 2250 articles per month; read estimated 29,000 people. Most frequent posters belong motorcycle club, Denizens Doom, usually referred DoD. The DoD started motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote couple parodies designed poke fun motorcycle stereotypes. Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted articles pen name, "Denizen Doom." A later Chuck Rogers signed DoD nr. 0003 Keeper Flame. Bruce designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, course, Nickerson, originator parodies, given DoD nr. 0001. The idea motorcycle club organization, meetings rules appealed many, John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper List, issuing DoD numbers anyone wanted one. To date almost 400 memberships issued people United States Canada, well Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway Finland. Keeper List Sloan eventually designed club patch. The initial run 300 patches sold immediately. The profits went American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation. Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens Doom pins members -- started Arnie Skurow months later. Again, project successful profits donated foundation. So far, Denizens contributed $1500 AMA museum. A plaque name Denizens oom hangs Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As often possible, DoD'ers crawl behind CRTs go riding together. It turns two largest concentrations DoD'ers centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, California's "Silicon Valley." onsequently, two major events annual Assault Rollins Pass Colorado, Northern versus Southern California "Joust." The Ride-and-Feed bike trip Rollins Pass, followed big barbecue dinner. The concept Joust riders Northern California ride south; riders Southern California ride north, meeting predesignated site somewhere middle. An additional plan 1991 hold official Denizens Doom homecoming conjunction MA heritage homecoming Columbus, Ohio, July. Though it's safe bet Denizens oom collective communications hub, rec.motorcycles, replace traditional motorcycle organizations, prowl electronic pathways search two-wheeled camaraderie, it's great way kindred spirits get together. Long may flame. "Live Flame -- Flame Live" [centerbar] This official motto Denizens Doom refers ease gratuitously insult someone electronically, would anything like face face. These insults known "flames"; issuing called "flaming." Flames often start member disagrees something another member posted network. A typical, sophisticated, intelligent form calm, reasoned rebuttal would something like: "What incredibly stupid statement, Spandex-clad poseur!" This guarantee five people reply defense original poster, describing think you, riding ability cat. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _The Denizens Doom: The Saga Unfolds_ John Sloan DoD #0011 Periodically question "What DoD?" raised. This one questions class "Why sky blue?", "If God, much suffering world?" "Why women inevitably tell you're nice guy dump you?", kinds questions steeped mysticism, tradition, philosophy, questions inspired research discussion philosophers locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, halls academe generations. A long, long time ago (in computer time, anything minutes eternity halting problem really problem) computer far, far away net (topologically speaking; two machines room Atlanta might route mail one another via system Chicago), chap wished remain anonymous (but eventually assigned DoD membership #1) wrote satire various personalities flame wars rec.motorcycles, signed "The Denizen Doom". Not wishing identify himself, asked stalwart individual would fullness time become DoD #2 post him. DoD #2, really giving whit people thought generally right thinking individual, so. Flaming amusements followed. He would become holder DoD membership #3 thought funniest thing he'd seen (being sort pretty easily amused), claimed membership Denizens Doom Motorcycle Club, started signing postings membership number. Perhaps readers rec.motorcycles struck vision motorcycle club dues, rules, restrictions brand make model national origin motorcycle, club organized electronically. It may well readers yearning become part something would provide greater identity, gestalt personality, something whole greater sum parts. It could also we're computer nerds wear black socks sneakers pocket protectors, happen also love taking risks machines awesome power weight ratios, social outcasts saw clique would finally open minded enough accept us members. In clear case self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens Doom Motorcycle Club born. A club majority members never met one another face face (and perhaps like way), yet feel know one another pretty well (or well enough given electronic personalities newsgroup). A club organized run (in loosest sense word) volunteers network via electronic news mail, membership/mailing list (often used organize group rides amongst members live region), motto, logo, series photo albums circulating around country (organized DoD #9), club patches (organized #11), even MTV-style music video (produced #47 distributed VHS #18)! Where end? Who knows? Will DoD start sanctioning races, placing limits memory clock rate on-board engine management omputers? Will DoD organize poker runs participant collects hand hardware software reference cards? ill DoD rally attendees demand terminal room least 386-sized UNIX system? Only time tell. The DoD dues, rules, requirements net access love motorcycles. To become member, one need ask (although admit must ask one really good club secrets). New members receive via email membership number latest copy membership list, includes name, state, email address. The Denizens Doom Motorcycle Club live forever (or least next year may decided change name).

I guess there. I wasn't.) Chuck: I didn't want Software Systems Analyst, cow-towing whims machine, saying yessir, nosir, may-I-have-another-sir. My mother made it.

A small throng Hell's Angels sit Harleys near background, gunning engines, showering lookers-on nails turn donuts, leaking oil tarmac.

You may heard ention various DoD trinkets patches & pins. And reaction probably: "I want!", "That's sick!", perhaps "That's sick! I want!" Well, there's good news bad news. The good news there's amazing variety DoD-labeled widgets created. The ad news isn't anywhere buy them. This isn't "exclusivity" attempt, simply "DoD store" keeps stock. All creations done individual Denizens pockets. The typical procedure someone says "I'm thinking DoD frammitz made, they'll cost $xx.xx, $xx.xx going AMA museum. Anyone want one?" Then orders taken, batch frammitzes large enough cover pre-paid orders produced (and quickly consumed). So want DoD doodad, act quickly next time somebody decides one. Or produce one see void needs filling, anarchy action. Here's possibly incomplete list known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99), motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts (DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), patches (DoD#99) [a second batch done (and rapidly consumed) popular demand]. All "profits" onated American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As June 1992, $5500 dollars contributed museum fund DoD. If visit museum, you'll see large plaque Founders' Wall name "Denizens Doom, USENET, The World", complete DoD pin. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Here's letter AMA DoD regarding contributions. ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT I received following letter Jim Rogers, director Museum, day.
