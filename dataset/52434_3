For review, refer _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 June 1919. Rogers' methods used extensively World War, unclassified war. Supposedly, government rethought soon after, Rogers convieniently forgotten. The bottom line antennas grounded send HALF signal ground. The half travels space quickly dissapated (by square distance), travels ground disapate all. Furthermore, published data showed noise drowned regular reception, underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free. IF find hard believe, refer work man INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed Rogers' methods correct, Hertzian wave theory completely "abberant". ---- ET "Tesla 100 years ahead time. Perhaps time comes." ----
