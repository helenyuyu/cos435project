The summaries attempt represent position much net community settled. Please DON'T bring unless there's something truly new discussed. The net can't set public policy, that's representatives for. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS Despite widespread belief contrary, Saturn V blueprints lost. They kept Marshall Space Flight Center microfilm. The problem re-creating Saturn V finding drawings, finding vendors supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like guidance system components), fact launch pads VAB converted Space Shuttle use, place launch from. By time redesign accommodate available hardware re-modify launch pads, may well started scratch clean sheet design. WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE Investigators associated NASA missions allowed exclusive access one year data obtained order give opportunity analyze data publish results without "scooped" people uninvolved mission. However, NASA frequently releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) public early mission. RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES There extensive discussion topic sparked attempts block Galileo Ulysses launches grounds plutonium thermal sources dangerous. Numerous studies claim even worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion launch, accidental reentry interplanetary velocities), risks extremely small. Two interesting data points (1) The May 1968 loss two SNAP 19B2 RTGs, landed intact Pacific Ocean Nimbus B weather satellite failed reach orbit. The fuel recovered 5 months release plutonium. (2) In April 1970, Apollo 13 lunar module reentered atmosphere SNAP 27 RTG heat source, jettisoned, fell intact 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials RTG expected prevent release fuel period time equal 10 half-lives Pu-238 fuel 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER From time time, claims made chemicals released Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) responsible significant amount damage ozone layer. Studies indicate reality minute impact, absolute terms relative chemical sources. The remainder item response author quoted study, Charles Jackman. The atmospheric modelling study space shuttle effects stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, organized Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute Space Studies. The three groups involved Michael Prather Maria Garcia (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), Malcolm Ko Dak Sze (Atmospheric Environmental Research, Inc.). The effort look effects space shuttle Titan rockets stratosphere. The following estimated sources stratospheric chlorine: Industrial sources: 300,000,000 kilograms/year Natural sources: 75,000,000 kilograms/year Shuttle sources: 725,000 kilograms/year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles 6 Titan rockets launched yearly. Thus launches would add less 0.25% total stratospheric chlorine sources. The effect ozone minimal: global yearly average total ozone would decreased 0.0065%. This much less total ozone variability associated volcanic activity solar flares. The influence human-made chlorine products ozone computed atmospheric model calculations 1% decrease globally averaged ozone 1980 1990. The influence space shuttle Titan rockets stratosphere negligible. The launch schedule Space Shuttle Titan rockets would need increased factor hundred order effect ozone increases industrial halocarbons present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE If *don't* try hold breath, exposure space half minute unlikely produce permanent injury. Holding breath likely damage lungs, something scuba divers watch ascending, you'll eardrum trouble Eustachian tubes badly plugged up, theory predicts -- animal experiments confirm -- otherwise, exposure vacuum causes immediate injury. You explode. Your blood boil. You freeze. You instantly lose consciousness. Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly [mild, reversible, painless] swelling skin underlying tissue) start ten seconds so. At point lose consciousness lack oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one two minutes, you're dying. The limits really known. References: _The Effect Chimpanzee Rapid Decompression Near Vacuum_, Alfred G.

This well-documented fact; see Rogers Commission report, example. What looked like explosion fuel burning external tank came apart. The forces crew cabin sufficient kill astronauts, never mind destroy bodies, according Kerwin team's medical/forensic report. The astronauts killed more-or-less intact cabin hit water circa 200MPH, bodies spent several weeks underwater. Their remains recovered, Kerwin team examined them, sent buried. USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT You can't use shuttle orbiter missions beyond low Earth orbit can't get there. It big heavy carry enough fuel, even fill part cargo bay tanks. Furthermore, particularly sensible so, much weight things like wings, totally useless except immediate vicinity Earth. The shuttle orbiter highly specialized travel Earth's surface low orbit. Taking higher enormously costly wasteful. A much better approach would use shuttle subsystems build specialized high-orbit spacecraft. [Yet another concise answer Henry Spencer.] THE "FACE ON MARS" There really big rock Mars looks remarkably like humanoid face. It appears two different frames Viking Orbiter imagery: 35A72 (much facelike appearance, one often published, Sun 10 degrees western horizon) 70A13 (with Sun 27 degrees west). Science writer Richard Hoagland championed idea Face artificial, intended resemble human, erected extraterrestrial civilization. Most analysts concede resemblance likely accidental. Other Viking images show smiley-faced crater lava flow resembling Kermit Frog elsewhere Mars. There exists Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't know address) study Face. The Mars Observer mission carry extremely high-resolution camera, better images formation hopefully settle question years.
